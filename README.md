Express Guard (express-guard) allows you to manage the requests made to your express server. It's built to be simple and has a powerful syntax. With Express Guard, you only have to define allowed Features (such as 'viewPosts', 'removePost'...) for different user Roles (such as 'admin', 'postOwner'). Then  When a request is made to your server, the middleware will check the corresponding access policy and return a result based on the user's permissions.
